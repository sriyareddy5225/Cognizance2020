>area of triangle
* The area of a triangle is defined as the total region that is enclosed by the three sides of any particular triangle. 
* it is equal to half of the base times height
*  Area of triangle = 1/2 × b × h.
* where,

    1. b=base of triangle
    2. h=height of triangle

>table for formulae:-

|**name of triangle**|**formula for finding area**|
|--------------------|-----------------------------|
|isosceles triangle|  ½ × b × h
|right triangle| ½ × b × h
|equilateral triangle| ½ × b × h

>algorithm to find area of triangle:-

* A=area of triangle

* b=Bredth ,h=height.

* Formula=1/2×b×h.

Algorithm:

* -Step 1:-Start.

* Step 2:-Declare at,b,has float.

* Step 3:-Initialize value of b and h.

* Step 4:-Calculate at 1/2×b×h.

* Step 5:-print area of triangle .

* Step 6:-End.
